Needed custom generation for small terrain area around an airfield and decided to extend old OSM2XP app to support this
What is already done?
## Generation of
* Roads
* Railways
* Power lines
* Fence, walls
* Water tanks, fuel tanks, gasometers
* Chimneys (creating custom OBJs for them)

## As well as
* Improved facade set editor
* Generating smaller area, then 1 tile - just as much as PBF file (provided e.g. by https://extract.bbbike.org/ ) defines
* Migration to Java 8 and some UI fixes

## Nearest plans
